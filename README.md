#### 180-degree turn: the beautiful world of IT and programming

I'm studying at Codecool coding school in Hungary since last October. I attend in junior system administrator  
course, because I am interested in this area of IT heavily.

Codecool's course mentioned above take emphasis on Linux-based systems (particularly Ubuntu, version 18.04 LTS).
Our mentors not just fill loads of boring stuff into our brains, but show us real-life examples, set really nice and sometimes hard-to-solve tasks. Thanks to this teaching attitude, I've got the following skills:

* ***I simply love writing bash scripts.***  
In my opinion, every bash script you've made can contain something new and surprising, and of course, almost everything can be done by bash scripts.
* ***I have some experience in virtualization softwares and technologies like VirtualBox and Vagrant.***  
  I can write Vagrantfiles to build and initialize a virtual machine in VirtualBox, with a predetermined purpose (appliaction  
deployment and hosting in particular).
* ***I've met and practiced a lot with Docker and Docker Compose, so I have some insight in containerization.***  
With Docker, it's quite easy to install and maintain a well-equipped application server system which consists of one or more database and one or more web server node, and, as far as it needed, a load balancer. I have some experience in automatization of Docker container establishing and configuration by bash scripts from zero.
* ***I can write queries in SQL language. It isn't a problem for me to use PostgreSQL and MySQL too.***  
At school, we've learnt some fundamental keywords and features, but I can join  tables and filter selected result, and do some aggregation and grouping. This is an area in what I'm really interested in, and I would like to learn as much as it's possible about data processing (methods, softwares, and so on).
* ***I've had the honour to get my hands dirty with AWS cloud provider system's features.***  
I'm able to configure an EC2 instance or do the same with a pre-configured RDS database instance with PostgreSQL or MySQL on it. I can establish private or public connection between AWS instances or link an instance to another physical or virtual machines. My knowledge expands to monitoring these networks via log analysis.
* ***Our curriculum covered basics of networking and, of course, some pracitcal knowledge about this field.***  
Phrases like OSI model, TCP/IP model, HTTP, TCP, UDP, IP, ARP, DHCP, DNS are sounds familiar for me. I also came to know some useful tools (primarily on Linux-based platforms), such as ping, traceroute, top, ip, ifconfig, netstat, nslookup, to explore and identify network shortages, problems.
