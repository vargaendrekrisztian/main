## Welcome to my reference GitHub repository!

### *My name is Endre Varga, and I have created this repo to upload some piece of information about me.*

I'm studying at Codecool coding school in Hungary since October, 2020. I attend in junior system administrator  
course, because I am interested in this area of IT heavily.

Codecool's course mentioned above take emphasis on Linux-based systems (particularly Ubuntu, version 18.04 LTS).  
Because so, I love writing bash scripts. In my opinion, every bash script you've made can contain something new and surprising :)

I have some experience in virtualization softwares and technologies like VirtualBox and Vagrant.  
I can write Vagrantfiles to build and initialize a virtual machine in VirtualBox, with a predetermined purpose (appliaction  
deployment and hosting in particular).

I can write queries in SQL language. There isn't a problem for me to use PostgreSQL and MySQL too.
